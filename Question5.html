  <p>Google Fonts (formerly known as Google Web Fonts) is a computer font and web font service owned by Google. This
    includes free and open source font families, an interactive web directory for browsing the library, and APIs for
    using the fonts via CSS[2] and Android.[3] Popular fonts in the Google Fonts library include Roboto, Open Sans,
    Lato, Oswald, Montserrat, and Source Sans Pro.
  </p>
  <p>As of October 2023, Google Fonts had 1,569 font families, including 346 variable font families.[10]
    The library is maintained through Google Fonts' GitHub repository, where all font files can be obtained directly.
    Source files for many of the fonts are available from git repositories within the Google Fonts' GitHub organization,
    along with libre software tools used by the Google Fonts community.
